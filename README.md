# Private_Chat
 Windows Form Private Chat

# V1.0

- Database Connection Management: Users can now connect and disconnect from the database at will.

- Dynamic Connection ID: Each time a user connects, a unique connection ID is generated. This ID is completely deleted from the database when the user disconnects. If the user reconnects, a new connection ID is assigned.

- Chat Invitation: Users can send a chat invitation to another client, with the option to accept or reject the invitation.

- Connection Status Visibility: Users can now see whether they are connected or disconnected from the database.
